fatma Bouraoui,1.0,2023 05 28,"Don't go to the cage if you want non-alcoholic coffee and dessert. Millefeuille at $9 in edible soft and not crispy, unemployment cake that looks nothing like unemployment cake, a waiter who looks down on you if you don't order alcohol ... just remove the desserts from the menu. The rest is correct but over over priced"
Me,2.0,2023 05 26,"Sports bar: giant tv screens, worn carpets, lots of noise. On the plus side, we were served promptly and the burger was decent. Salad tasted like toilet cleaner. Waiter seemed overworked."
Paul Milroy,5.0,2023 05 25,"Great food, Honorable employers; 1 Timothy 5:18 NCV because the Scripture says: ‚ÄúWhen an ox is working in the grain, do not cover its mouth to keep it from eating,‚Äù and ‚ÄúA worker should be given his pay.‚Äù"

Nooman Kahwaji,1.0,2023 05 17,The host at the front door was extremely rude and condescending to me and my friend. I had a reservation at 8pm and she made me wait in line with the people who did not have reservation for no apparent reason. The manager spoke with her and apologized for her rude behavior. He said the reason she was impolite was because of her age (18 year old). Teach the greeting staff to have some manners.

Jason Miller,5.0,2023 05 10,Pleasantly surprised. I was expecting a generic sports bar and grill and found a truly great restaurant with the best wings I have had in Montreal. Wow.
Miguel Manyari,1.0,2023 05 10,"Went there to watch formula 1 , we made a reservation and when the race started there was not sound, we went to the employees and they told us with disdain: ""Sorry, there's no sound for Formula 1 you should've asked on the phone before coming"" , like we were supposed to know which is outrageous and extremely frustrating. Worst experience ever, never coming back."
supraman49 Morgan,1.0,2023 05 10,"Not able to take reservations if they have more than 30 people arriving at the same time... Rental in the city center, chamber of commerce that fights for workers to return to the office, but businesses do not provide? Whatever, please hire managers who care about revenue and not their own limitation!"
David Weber,1.0,2023 05 10,They forgot about our food. People around us were getting their food and than the waitress comes to us...havent you received your food yet. About 5 minutes later she comes back. There was a problem with the computer and it seems to have dropped our order. Not very impressive.
Jamie B,3.0,2023 05 10,"We came during lunch. There is no lunch menu, so you must pay dinner prices at lunch. Interestingly, this doesn't seem to bother people since the restaurant was packed. Arrive before 12 o'clock to avoid the rush of people that descend upon the restaurant from their offices in Complexe Desjardins during weekdays. Good food. The meal took some time to arrive. Free popcorn is a cute touch."
Yvan,3.0,2023 05 03,"The atmosphere at the Cage Aux Sports is incredible! The welcome is the service is impressive. I ordered a Spicy Burger üçî üêî not pleasant. The chicken was sweet tough and cold. I specified that I would like very hot fries. Fries arrived lukewarm. They changed them for other lukewarm fries. I was changed the üçî for one on beef charcoal, delicious. The 3 stars are for the atmosphere, the service, the welcome and the Charcoal Burger. This is my first impression of this Cage Aux Sports."

Tala Jabbary,1.0,2023 04 30,I cannot say how disappointed I was. We ordered fish & chips with mushroom burger. The fries was soggy and not fresh and the fish and beef patty were burnt and smelled highly like burnt oil. My fries were floating in oil. In general absolute fiasco in food. The only nice thing about the place was the beer!
Jessica W,5.0,2023 04 30,"We were in MTL for the weekend and wanted to catch the fights, seeking a bar comparable to Real Sports in Toronto. Loaded with big screens, nice energy, good drinks. I had a margarita, the red sangria (SO GOOD) and the Buffalo poutine which was ridiculously delicious. Topped it off with the chocolate cake, this spot did not disappoint!"
Sandrella Abou Zeidan,5.0,2023 04 30,Really good place to hangoutI recommend
Nicolas Le Brun,5.0,2023 04 30,A good restaurant bar to enjoy sports matches with friends. Located rue Ste Catherine the passage in this restaurant is worth the detour. You will not be disappointed.

The waitress asked if we wanted dessert and then when we asked to order she said that the kitchen is closed. She then gave another customer the wrong drink and when she asked for the right one she brought back the same drink. We didn‚Äôt give a tip due to this bad service and she then took away a drink that was unfinished and when we asked for it back she didn‚Äôt apologise and slammed it on the table. She then asked why we didn‚Äôt give a tip and when we said why she stormed off."

Virgile Barbieux,3.0,2023 03 31,"Went there for a game as recommended by many people and friends. Most people there weren't here for or even aware of the game - we also had one of the screens turned off suddenly. When asked to turn it back on we were first mentioned it would not be possible. After a few minutes we were offered to move to another location which was nice. Unfortunately from that table it was quite hard to see any of the screens, most of them being placed too high, or too far. Service was ok but the staff was super busy, hence not really available. Overall quite disappointing."

Samuel C√¥t√©,1.0,2023 03 31,The owner's tata of the establishment who decides to put on a damn soccer game in the middle of the Montreal Canadiens game.

Excellent evening...Thank you to the whole team."
PIERRICK PIROTTE,4.0,2023 02 28,Excellent place to spend some time with friends or family. Best place to go and watch CH play. They make good dishes like Buffalo poutine. I recommend it to you without hesitation. I loved it! The staff are very pleasant and intentional. üôÇ

Jean-claude D.,3.0,2022 12 31,"Inside this place people are too stacked when there are more of them it should be even worse which becomes a very difficult vibe. I note that this Cage is not big enough, lit enough, noises of all kinds give dizziness which can very well affect the ears and the behavior of people. This could also be a reality. What I like about his Places is their terraces outside during the summer, inside to endure so much noise maybe sometimes or often, I could very well do without it."

Every time we come to Montreal we go to lacage, but it's over. Maybe that's why there are fewer and fewer people, given the service. survey code 94956404"

Vick T.,1.0,2022 10 31,"We went here since it was a nice looking Sports bar. They had really big nice tvs but unfortunately no sound instead they were playing some music over the games. We ordered a bang bang shrimp bowl and 16 buffalo sauce wings. The shrimp bowl had 5 shrimp that were burned (breaded) and had a few lines of spicy mayo on it. The wings were plain old wings with no sauce on it. When we pointed this out we were told sometimes that's how it turns out and were given cold Buffalo sauce to dip our wings in. I got a blonde beer called the Matin which was good and my wife ordered their only cider but they were out. She then wanted daiquiri but their blender was broken, so then she finally ordered a raspberry cocktail. We got their volcano cake and creme Brule and they weren't horrible or great. Overall, this place was a real let down compared to other Montr√©al diners and bars. All in all don't be fooled by the looks, the food is doo doo. If you come here go for the beer and that's about it."

The penultimate time I went, the waiter took too long to put on our order and was rude to us, then took 27 minutes just to bring us our bill. I gave them another chance and thought it was just a one time bad experience, but the most recent time I went was tonight. The waitress saw that I was with my toddler and was immediately dismissive of my family. She took 30 mins just to get our order and the people next to us had arrived after us, ordered at the same time as us, received their food, FINISHED their food and the waitress said it would just be a bit longer (it had been 1h20 mins). My son became deliriously tired and we had to walk out and get something else to eat before our food ever arrived. I‚Äôm NEVER GOING HERE AGAIN. Worst service EVER!!!"

The lobsters mini rolls were horrible , it was more like lettuce sandwich. Couldn't taste or see the lobsters. They took over 40 min to get us the appetizer then it was wrong and then the main dish showed up. Not the best experience at all but location is good. Doubt that i will return to it."

In short, we will not be returning during our stay."
Leo FORTIN,5.0,2022 09 30,
Tracy Carignan,2.0,2022 08 31,"Great location, unfortunately the food was horrible. We ordered the wings, they were extremely small, they were all either burnt or very well done. Came with 1 carrot slice and 1 celery slice. The popcorn was rubbery and the fries were burnt. Very very disappointing. When I told the waiter we were not pleased with the over cooked food he seemed unfazed and made no attempt to give us a rebate on our bill. Maybe we just got unlucky but based off of this experience I would not recommend this location."
Regis Auda,2.0,2022 08 31,"The smallest chicken wings I've ever eaten. The floor was dirty, full of popcorn on the ground, a waitress knocked over a glass and a bowl of popcorn, neither she nor her partners picked it up, 15min for a clearing attendant to put the bottle ... vertically always on the ground. barely if he didn't step over it. And a lukewarm Bloody Caesar. In short, avoid."

KING KEROZEN,5.0,2022 08 31,
Alain Tremblay,2.0,2022 08 31,"Very disappointing! The wings, small and way overcooked, were totally unsatisfactory. In addition, coke is ""flattering"" and tasteless. Even at half price, it's not worth the detour. I miss La Cage aux Sports from the 80s and 90s. Now, it's very expensive and it's a big eye-catcher. ""We play it"" without delivering the goods."

Christine Zhang,3.0,2022 08 31,"Close to the office during lunch hour. The Tuesday $10 promotion was interesting. Although the Bang Bang shrimp bowl was a healthy choice, there were only 5 pieces of shrimp, not enough Bang Bang sauce in the salad and lots of rice. We had waited a long time to pay the bill because the server had forgotten about us."
Alexandra Buccilli,1.0,2022 08 31,"Good morning. I was with Delphine and Vivi that evening... We were made to wait 40-50 minutes and we had to go see the hostess because we never had any follow-up for all this waiting time. When we went to see her, we were treated to disparaging remarks as well as vague answers. Basically, they didn't care that the wait was endless. Unfortunately, the one who seemed to be ""responsible"" that evening told us with a small smile that an hour and a half before a show, it was not early enough and made us leave. In short, even if you have a show near this restaurant, don't go there, unless you like to wait 40 minutes and then eat from the Subway next door because all the other restaurants are full! If I could, I would have given 0!"

Joannie Collard,1.0,2022 08 31,"This is the first negative comment I leave, but I must share my experience. I attempted to go to this branch for dinner and was refused entry with my stroller and 2 month old baby. Understand, baby could enter, but I had to leave the stroller (his pram) in the entrance of the restaurant unattended. You are aware that a 2 month old baby cannot be placed in a high chair or on a booster. So we decided not to eat there. The restaurant is large and there is plenty of room to put a stroller there without hindering the work of the waiters (his) while maintaining the comfort of my child. We went to eat in several places with our baby (even at another sports cage) and we were never refused access like this, even in so-called ""upscale"" restaurants. If I could have given 0 stars I would have. This practice is completely discriminatory and unjustified."
D C,1.0,2022 08 31,"Service was good, food was not. Cage is a Quebec company and I expected a proper poutine but the cage gravy is awful. Their ""911"" hot sauce for their chicken wings should be called ""mild spicy"", it is definitely not 911... my 10 yr old daughter and her friends tried them and didn't really find them hot. I fi d the food at Royal Oak much much better."

What I do for 10 minutes. I ask what is happening and I am told that there was an error in the order. Really! an all for one? I am asked to wait again. What I do for 10 minutes. I still wonder what happens. After several questions, they finally admit that my start was served at a table by mistake. I had to wait 30 minutes in total for a relatively simple dish. Is this normal? Can I cancel my order when I have already paid with their app? No! Can I reduce the tip amount with the app because I'm not satisfied? No! My other 2 orders also had problems. I learned my lesson, I will not order take out at this restaurant."

We were told it's totally fine to bring the cake we just have to order food and they can't keep the cake in the fridge. We showed and they didn't let us have the cake saying that it was a miscommunication and it's impossible to serve cake brought from outside and we can alternatively order the cake they have on the menu. If we knew this in advance we could have easily reserved somewhere else. I don't believe this is the first time they're dealing with a birthday party and find this beyond unprofessional and disappointing.

The prices are insane, the food is okay at best, you could probably find better 10$ meals at a food court. My club looked liked a regular sandwich...it was just odd all around. Would not recommend.

Olga Mikhalchuck,2.0,2022 05 31,"Unfortunately the management does not follow the rules of the government. Two people from different addresses can not come with their children, though in the rules for the red zone it is written ""Maximum of 2 people from different addresses at the same table, may be accompanied by their children under the age of 18. "" (Please, see the screen shot of the rules attached). When I asked to book 2 tables for us in this case providing all contact information they required, they refused, as: -two tables if people who know each other could not be near even though there is a 2m distance (Nothing is written in the rules about it.) - the second table should be booked by another person and he/she should be presented in the brasserie in person. At first the manager told me that these are the rules of the red zone. When I showed him what is in fact written in the rules, he told that they do not care, they have their own rules then. P.S.: At first I wanted to put 1 star, but then changed it to 2 stars, as I was in La Cage breweries before and really liked the atmosphere there, unfortunately it turns to be toxic now. Hope they will fix it soon."

At the entrance in front of me there were 5 hosts they were chatting so I got ignored. It's better to have one caring person than 5 not knowing what to do with a single customer. üòÖ The food is not the best gastronomic experience, but the terrace, the place, the table service is worth the visit. Value for money makes sense and I really appreciated my server who showed professionalism at all times. He and the rest of the servers deserve the 5 stars."

But why does no one offer a solution before... Why have to wait an hour to be served?? Really disappointing service... Time wasted! Unfortunately this is the last time I'll be back here.
Juliette Fong,3.0,2022 05 31,Fish taco was great when I finally got it. It Was a take out order but after waiting over half an hour I asked the bartender if it was ready she went into the kitchen to find it
Blizter47,1.0,2022 05 31,"Appalling service. The waitress speaks badly to you, it takes 1 hour to respond to your request (1 hour for napkins, another hour for 1 glass of water, and 1 hour for a pitcher of beer). With hindsight, I shouldn't even have given any tips. In addition the same waitress manages to make a mistake counting two pitchers of beer when we had ordered only one. A similar story happened with the group of 8 next to us, they had a lot of double billing. Managers on duty try to recover from staff mistakes as best they can... One thing is for sure, last night is the last time I'm going back there."

Alejandro Chac√≥n,1.0,2022 05 31,"One hour of waiting after ordering, after asking why it took so long to get the order, they told us that there were no more Nachos (ordered as a starter), ok, we cancel the starter, 15 min later, they inform us of a kitchen problem, it will take longer for the strong dishes, so we didn't eat. At least the free beer."
Jeremy Latreille,3.0,2022 05 31,"Definitely not a place to eat a steak the cooking was perfect it is rather the piece of meat... the quality leaves something to be desired.

I waited more than an hour for a drink while she was hugging customers, I had to ask her twice. At the time of the addition, surprise, she made a mistake and when we pointed it out to her, she replied to sort it out for you, it's the same. The height, she added things to us that our table did not order and it was an obstacle course to be reimbursed. Surprised, she made a mistake and added things to the surrounding tables. One had over $100 added because she hadn't taken payment from someone who left earlier. Really very disappointed and of course not to go"

The burger pattie was burnt, hence the bottom piece of bread that held the spinach had weird black oily stains We wanted to send the burger back but the server never made it back to our table (understandable the place was packed). To be honest I was shocked that a place this popular has burgers that you needed to drown in condiments to get any flavor. Then as a we were leaving I decided to go to the bathroom and as I walked towards the bathroom past the bar I had a bizarre encounter with a confrontational male server who cut me off asking me where I was going....I said the washroom and walked past him. From the central location where he cut me off I could have been headed to the bar, dining room or washroom...I thought it was very strange. Needless to say there isnt anything about this location that made me wanna ever go back, maybe the Quebec brewed beers but we shall see üò©ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

The restaurant is very nice, the service was perfect, and all the tv's around are pretty pleasant and if you think they will bother you, they won't. You forget they're there after a while. We got a really good table next to a plug so I got to charge my phone before the concert. I think the prices for certain meals is a bit high but there seems to be something in the menu for most price points and appetites. I ordered a pina colada (was feeling fancy), and it was freaking delicious. The best pina colada I've had in my life (also the third pina colada I've ever had). My cousin and I got the plate to share and it came with chicken fingers, chicken wings, these sausage thingies, and potato skins. Everything was good except the potato skins, those were eh. I love it here!"

Amadou diallo,1.0,2020 05 31,"Bad customer service with a waitress who, in addition to being rude, is a real liar. Worse than that we had to deal with a racist manager who asks us to leave the restaurant and he adds ""Get out of here anyway there will be people and we will fill up""."
Jonathan Wells,5.0,2020 05 31,"My friend and I had a few appetizers and a pitcher of beer for a light dinner. Everything was wonderful! The beer was good, the prices were okay, the fish tacos were to die for, the poutine was good, and the service was fair. It is a sports bar styled restaurant and has a lot of T.V.'s to easily watch sports on. It is noisy, and I say this not as a negative, just to remind you of the atmosphere to expect at a sports bar. The decore is fun, consisting of hockey sticks, baseball bats, and beer kegs."

Nadir Rouyes,1.0,2020 05 31,"Very bad service the hostesses the one at the reception and specially the other one who place the guests they were impolite when we asked her for a table she took us to the very corner of the restaurant I told her we don't like this spot can you give us another table as i could see they were some others empty, she was like THIS IS THE ONLY TABLE I HAVE and she left without explaining her self or saying sorry. So me and my people we didn't like this cheeky attitude from the girl, as a result we've decided to go to another restaurant as we felt not welcomed in there. The bad thing is, at the checking out i mentioned to the girl at the reception that we didn't like the other girl's behaviour neither how we've been treated she didn't even care or saying a word."
Michael M.,4.0,2020 05 31,I went to this location with my cousin and we ordered 2 drinks with poutine and 911 wings. The poutine lacked sauce and the wings were definitely not 911 spicy but rather slightly spicy Buffalo. I had to ask for more sauce to be able to continue eating the poutine. The service was really good for a very hectic evening. I will definitely go back.

Suicide Guy656,2.0,2020 05 31,Nice atmosphere and good place to go and watch the games on big TV. But the food is not good at all.
Marie-Paule Dessaint,4.0,2020 05 31,"The place is beautiful, well located and the food excellent, really excellent. We also care to get feedback from us. The first time the server was exceptional, attentive, truly exceptional. I would have given 6 stars out of 5. This time, Friday, I was badly served by a waitress for whom I do not exist, any more than the other customers. Not pleasant... and does not make an effort to be heard. I had to get up... to understand her. Following my assessment, I was called! I felt like in a court because I was asked to justify my evaluation of the waitress!!! And then, I have just seen the reviews and I realize that I am not the only one to have been badly served.. Too bad because I love the place. The terrace is beautiful.. and even the toilets!!"
dior dieng,1.0,2020 05 31,"Very very very bad service!!!! Servers, supervisor and manager who don't care about their customers. Our table was reserved the day before but when we got there, they had already given it to others. The attitude waitress.... NOT RECOMMENDED PLACE. AN INTOLERABLE LACK OF RESPECT! The manager clearly told us that ‚ÄúWITH OR WITHOUT YOU I WILL MAKE MY TURNOVER‚Äù"
Maxime Le Flaguais,1.0,2020 05 31,"I waited for my salad for an hour and a half. It wasn't good. I got sick right after eating it. It was romaine lettuce and they didn't have to wash it. Moreover, the place was full but when the Canadians scored their first goal, no one cheered. The cage has lost its soul, there is no atmosphere in this place. Avoid at all costs."
i cruzito,4.0,2020 05 31,"Great sports bar. Busy place, sat at the bar, ordered a burger and got it quicker than expected. Great local brews on tap, tonnes of screens with sports, and popcorn was provided to snack on. Really friendly and good staff. Plenty of seating options, booths and tables. Definitely recommend."
Shannon V,3.0,2020 05 31,"This restaurant has very loud music, we couldn't carry on a conversation. The menu selection was good. The Buffalo chicken wrap was burnt and had no sauce. The salad had no flavour. Wait staff forgot our request for sauce and then miraculously remembered Street the table behind us also asked for more sauce. Worth a try if you're into sports bars."
Amine,2.0,2020 05 31,"Good burgers but extremely mediocre service, they are victims of their own success...some waiters are extremely rude and insensitive...if you just want to eat you will find your account with the burger but if you want to spend a nice evening as a couple or with friends or even with family I absolutely do not recommend it to you ... lately every time I go there I witness drama: waiters who criticize their customers, the receptionist who refuses access in a young couple impolitely on the pretext that they have a stroller even if the baby is sleeping (wake him up or go for a walk and come back if he wakes up, you want to talk to the manager ok settle down... the poor leave after 10min of waiting while the manager was good. There in front of them available... when they leave the receptionist warns the manager and laughs... it was really sad especially since the young couple remained polite and you could see it with their first baby... they were embarrassed.. never again is √† la cage...there is no shortage of great restaurants and brasseries in montreal."
amir shahshahani,4.0,2020 05 31,"Nice place, good service, good fish and chips and grilled chicken, just the portion was a bit lower than expected."
Diaa khalifeh,4.0,2020 05 31,Good vibe and atmosphere.... free popcorn all the time with refill ... good food ..... on Sundays you pay only $3 for your kids meals which I found fantastic....
Ibtissam Bahdaoui,1.0,2020 05 31,Racist manager and receptionist. I don't recommend this place.

Pablo Duque,1.0,2020 05 31,"food was good and the hostess really nice, but service was really bad, careless waitress I didn't mind leaving her $0 for her awful service."

Carly Elms,5.0,2020 05 31,Delicious food and quick service! The staff are very friendly!
Marjolaine G,4.0,2020 05 31,"I have zero insight into food but in terms of a sports bar, it does the job. Lots of seating space for large groups which makes it perfect for a 5 a 7. The service is friendly and fast. There‚Äôs free popcorn! They serve appetizers as well but there‚Äôs aren‚Äôt many vegan options. Vegetarian options are available. The crowd is more old and professional - not a rowdy place at all which makes it comfortable and not too loud."
trilok singh kachhawa,3.0,2020 05 31,"Huge space to sit and watch your favourite sports. Service was little slow. Food was tasty and nicely presented. Seems staff doesn‚Äôt care about the serving ethics, she was looking behind at someone‚Äôs table while putting the fork and spoon, which led to fork fall down on ground. These small things makes a huge difference. Suggestion - Coasters needed on the tables. They got free popcorns at entrance. Overall this place is little over priced."
Nordic Volkan,5.0,2020 05 31,"Yes this is a pretty decent Sport Bar to go & hang out . Place: Is located in the Place-Des-ART AREA so it was conveniently located near my Hotel . Drinks were good, female Bartenders were friendly & smiled a lot. However, I was there for the Guinness so I had 2 Pints and and Screwdriver(Vodka + orange juice) . Once the vodka kicked in I settled the check & left. This place is cleaned, packed with respectful young professional crowd . Also less intimidating unlike some other Graffiti-decorated-bars/places on Rue Saint-Catherine. So yea, you should go there , have a drink, watched some cable live sport on the TV & chill. Happy Drinking :)"

The crowd is good. I ended up watching some 18yr olds doing body shots for almost 30mins. That was unexpected but good entertainment after the amazing jazz nights, I would have given 5 stars if not for that. Overall I'd recommend it to all age groups.

The worst is that we got kicked out by a certain named ""Kevin"" 07/20/2018. The reason is that I wanted to file a complaint against him for the bad service he gave us. It is simply unacceptable. Not recommended even if you have no choice do not go there"

We want to claim the offer of free chicken wings (5 Canadian goals) and the waitress, AUDREY, makes us wait for hours. We end up paying and we continue to watch the UFC match. After receiving her tip and making us wait 3 hours, she ended up telling us in a silly tone that it's too late, the kitchen is closed. Then we ask for water, and it still doesn't come after 30 minutes, so we leave. Of the many times I've come, I've never had to deal with a waitress as stupid and incompetent as AUDREY."

Meriem Zouari,1.0,2018 05 31,"I tried the salmon ciabatta and the salmon was very cold. I mentioned it to the waitress who told her manager about it. The 2 made me the same offer which was to reserve the dish. As I had already eaten half, I said no. The manager told me that he will see what he can do without mentioning anything to me. My colleague also found a piece of paper in his bowl of mayonnaise. He just asked for his bowl to be changed. In the end I got a free drink but nothing for my colleague!! I'm just saying, if they don't like giving their customers a discount. They only have to do a quality control before taking the dishes out of their kitchen. Knowing that their dishes are made expensive for what it tastes like! The other point why is that the manager came to see me, if to offer me the same thing as the waitress at the start! He tried it just in case I said yes that I was given the same dish again? In short!! I go there sometimes, just because it's next to the job and every time I regret!!!"

Mike Lecky,2.0,2018 05 31,"I went here on an NFL Sunday. Giant tv and a bunch of good sized other ones but no sound on. Maybe there's sound for Habs games but not for football. I ordered a Caeser based off the photo of it in the menu (a pint sized drink) and received about 8oz of unimpressiveness. I ordered a burger and fries, the burger was dry and bland, the fries were cold. There are tons of sports bars in the area, if you want an actual sports bar experience this is not the place."

Alexandre Beaulieu,1.0,2017 05 31,"Total lack of organization: people who did not have a reservation passed before us, who had one. A first hostess told us that as we had a reservation we didn't have to wait in line; so we walked through the crowd to the reception desk. After 10 to 15 minutes of waiting we were told by another employee to go back to the front of the line. Completely unacceptable. We left immediately as it seemed pointless, even harmful, to have made a reservation. Flat also to display equipment for brewing beer, including huge tanks, in the window when in reality no beer seems to be brewed on site (to be confirmed, I concede); misleading marketing and a senseless use of expensive commercial space in my opinion."
Mario Bouvier,1.0,2017 05 31,"We had a reservation and we were placed in a section where we couldn't see the screens for the hockey game. From the explanations of the manager, we understood that the responsibility for customer service fell to the reservation system. So we went to their neighbor and had a great evening at the St-Hub."
